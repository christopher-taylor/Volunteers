# Seattle CoderDojo's Hacker Room Manifesto

## Why this document exists

We have a small handful of kids who come back to the Hacker Room on a regular or semi-regular basis, but we have more who come once and then don't come again. Absenteeism among those who register for it is high as well. With research and discussion, we've determined that the sort of "anything goes" structure is too free form for many kids and parents.

- We don't offer concrete paths to get from point A to point B. 
- Both points are often too loosely defined. 
- The selection of tutorials is stale and thin.
- It's lacking a tangible sense of momentum for the families.
- It has a thinner sense of shared purpose and community than other rooms.

The goal of this manifesto is to spark discussion among the Seattle CoderDojo volunteers, lay out a vision for solving these issues, and create a greater sense of momentum and impact for the volunteers who are dedicating their time.

We may be in our fifth year, but I'll steal a phrase from our primary host, Amazon.com. "It's always Day One." While I will provide the history of the room for context and some of the lessons learned, we are always a new group... new volunteers, new kids, new ideas. We should never be too set in our ways to follow a good idea as far as it will take us or let go of a bad one, no matter how long we've held onto it.

## History of the Hacker Room

The room we call the Hacker Room has gone by multiple names over the last 4 years. It was the JavaScript room, the Independent Study Room, and eventually the Hacker Room. When it was the JavaScript room, we tried running it in a manner like the Scratch Room, but there were a few issues.

- We didn't convey the value proposition of JavaScript well and many parents and older kids felt it wasn't teaching pro skills.
- Because JavaScript gets way more in-depth than Scratch, covering all the possible skill levels in an instructor-led environment became very difficult.
- Teaching 10 year olds to use Git was frustrating to a number of volunteers.

When we moved it to Independent Study (later renamed to Hacker), it became the "anything goes" model that I mentioned (and critiqued) above. We've tried to do things like bringing in content from the rotating classroom, break out and then incorporate in FreeCodeCamp, and other ideas. None were very big or very bold, and none really improved attendance or traction.



## A new vision for the Hacker Room 

### **We Will:**

- Provide structure, achievements, and a sense of progress
- Better communicate the value proposition to parents and kids
- Better communicate the progression cycle that leads from Code.org to the Hacker Room.
- Better evaluate the interests of the children to help them identify the best learning plan.

### **We Must:** 

- Support kids who can't come every session.
- Support skill levels ranging from "bored with Scratch" to "bored with AP Comp Sci".
- Create a stronger sense of shared purpose and belonging in the Hacker Room.

## How do we achieve this?

The [Hacker Room Menu](https://www.seattlecoderdojo.com/resources/developer-room/) represented a good start two years back, but it's thin, it's stale, and it's little more than it was back then. A few of the problems that have persisted:

- *Don't know where to start* - Pointing a family at the menu and saying "pick something" is not a good experience because they don't know what to pick. And we're not as good as helping them figure out where to start as we should be.
- *Lacking progression* - It's not only hard for both the new mentors and the families to know where to start, but to understand what the road ahead looks like, or what the end result will be. Giving them a target helps keep them on track toward it. Giving them milestones to achieve creates a sense of momentum and progression.
- *Poor categorization* - We don't have things separated/grouped in a consistent and defined manner that focuses on value propositions. We've got a few broad categories and that's it, and even then, things are not well categorized. For example, Code Monster is in introductory JavaScript tutorials. It should be in introductory Game Dev... or both.
- *Lack of content* - We simply don't have enough content properly catalogued and arranged to provide the breadth and depth we need to solve the other problems. I repeat: **thin and stale.**
- *Coding is a sport* - How do you get good at a sport? You play it and you practice it. There's no other way. We need to drill that home.

So let's examine how we can solve each problem.

### The Hacker Room Placement Exam and Progress Plan

We need to create an online exam or set of exams that help us evaluate where kids are. This should help us identify where the kids are strong, where they are weak, and what engages them. 

From that, a mentor who is trained in interpreting the results can sit down with the kid and parents and lay out a progress plan that has a sequence of goals for the child to achieve.

We will have an official form. The mentor will fill it out with the family as partners, helping them understand choices, goals, and how to get there. 

We'll have a printer in the room as well as a file box and manilla folders.  We will print two copies of the progress plan as well as committing a copy to a *private* repo that approved mentors can access. One printed copy will go in a folder with the child's name on it. One printed copy will be given to the family.

Each week the child attends, they'll get their folder to help them pick up where they left off, mark any progress they made at home between sessions, then mark the progress they made at Dojo.

#### Placement Exam Details

- **Typing Test:** Without keyboarding skills, the kids are going to have trouble keeping up in workshops.  We need to find a test that gives us an idea of their accuracy and speed.
  - If the child does not meet minimum accuracy and speed levels, they will not do JUST typing practice, but it will be made a part of their roadmap, where they spend 1/3 to 1/2 time on typing practice games and tutorials.
- **Math Skills:** This is to help understand where they are in their math concepts, calculation skills, formula construction. We're not worried about grade levels. We're worried about levels of programming math... cartesian 2D and 3D coordinate systems, basic algebra, boolean logic, etc.
- **Programming Concepts:** Variables, loops, functions, operators... do they know what they are and when to use them? Can they define a method and a property. Do they know what scope is?
- **What do they really like?**: This is the hardest, because it's a personality assessment to help recommend the best core paths.
- **Secondary tests:** If we place them on a core path based on these scores, there may be specific domain based knowledge that's worth testing for.
- **No cheating, no guessing, no help:** There's no grade, there's no good or bad score. "This helps us know where you are and what you need to learn. If you guess or get help, you'll miss out on learning cool stuff because we'll think you know it."

#### Progress Plan Details

- **Core Paths:** These are themed paths that focus on learning a specific skillset. Game Dev, 3D Design, 2D Design, App Dev, Web Dev, Arduino/RasPi Dev, Digital Music... The personality test helps us put the 2-3 most appropriate in front of them.
- **Path Milestones**: Based on the Typing, Math, and Concepts tests, we know which parts of the path they can skip, and which they need to do.
- **Milestone Markers:** The idea is to do this as alternating lesson and lab. Each tutorial milestone should be matched with a project to help them put those skills into practice and build something they can show off and get praised for.
- **Side Trips:** Optional tutorials or projects that can help reinforce or give a deeper insight into the skills associated with a milestone. 
- **Frequent Coder Miles:** As kids reach milestones, they can earn miles. As kids reach certain mile levels, they receive stickers for their laptops that show their progression. At the completion of their road map, they get something more substantial (TBD - maybe a low-cost imprinted multi-tool). Each year, we honor the highest achievers at the Hour of Code with awards (get a sponsor to pay for the trophies and brand the sponsor all year on the site).



## What We Need To Accomplish This

**Build the placement test:** Questions of our own, online evaluations that exist, scoring.

**Define Core Paths:**  What are the paths we want to put the kids on?

**Level Set:** Set milestone levels for the Core Paths -- at milestone X the student has learned and demonstrated competency with skills X and Y, concept Zed and Omega, etc. 

**Locate content:** What do we already have in our collection that fits the core paths and where? Volunteers who cannot make it on Sundays could form a research committee that looks for good free content online that fits core paths and milestone levels. They score the content based on quality, milestone fit, interactivity, time to complete a discrete unit/lesson. We can have a section of the Volunteer repo dedicated to core paths and suggesting/reviewing content for them.

**Develop Core Path Progress Plans:** Each core path needs its own project plan.

**Train the Trainer:** Figure out a training for Hacker Room mentors around proctoring the placement test, interpreting scores, and consulting with the kids/parents on which Core Path to select and where to start on it.

**Mentor Certification:** Come up with trainer certification plans for each Core Path so trainers can say "yes, I can assist kids with completing these core plans."

##### Possibly create a Scratch Core Path and a Code.org Core Path - no placement tests, but give the kids in those rooms the same ability to feel they're making progress, give them a cue for moving to the next room/level. And make it possible for them to earn frequent coder miles as well.
