# Seattle CoderDojo's Hacker Room Manifesto

## Why this document exists

We have a small handful of kids who come back to the Hacker Room on a regular or semi-regular basis, but we have more who come once and then bail. With research and discussion, we've determined that the sort of "anything goes" structure is too free form for many kids and parents.

- We don't offer concrete paths to get from point A to point B. 
- Both points are often too loosely defined. 
- The selection of tutorials is stale and thin.
- It's lacking a tangible sense of momentum for the families.
- It has a thinner sense of shared purpose and community than other rooms.

The goal of this manifesto is to spark discussion among the Seattle CoderDojo volunteers, lay out a vision for solving these issues, and create a greater sense of momentum and impact for the volunteers who are dedicating their time.

We may be in our fifth year, but I'll steal a phrase from our primary host, Amazon.com. "It's always Day One." While I will provide the history of the room for context and some of the lessons learned, we are always a new group... new volunteers, new kids, new ideas... weekly. We should never be too set in our ways to follow a good idea as far as it will take us.

## History of the Hacker Room

The room we call the Hacker Room has gone by multiple names over the last 4 years. It was the JavaScript room, the Independent Study Room, and eventually the Hacker Room. When it was the JavaScript room, we tried running it in a manner like the Scratch Room, but there were a few issues.

- We didn't convey the value proposition of JavaScript well and many parents and older kids felt it wasn't teaching pro skills.
- Because JavaScript gets way more in-depth than Scratch, covering all the possible skill levels in an instructor-led environment became very difficult.
- Teaching 10 year olds to use Git was frustrating to a number of volunteers.

When we moved it to Independent Study (later renamed to Hacker), it became the "anything goes" model that I mentioned (and critiqued) above. We've tried to do things like bringing in content from the rotating classroom, break out and then incorporate in FreeCodeCamp, and other ideas. None were very big or very bold, and none really improved attendance or traction.



## A new vision for the Hacker Room 

#### **We Will:**

- Provide structure, achievements, and a sense of progress
- Better communicate the value proposition to parents and kids
- Better communicate the progression cycle that leads from Code.org to the Hacker Room.
- Better evaluate the interests of the children to help them identify the best learning plan.

#### **We Must:** 

- Support kids who can't come every session.
- Support a skill levels ranging from "bored with Scratch" to "bored with AP Comp Sci".
- Create a stronger sense of shared purpose and belonging in the Hacker Room.

## How do we achieve this?

The [Hacker Room Menu](https://www.seattlecoderdojo.com/resources/developer-room/) represented a good start two years back, but it's thin, it's stale, and it's little more than it was back then. A few of the problems that have persisted:**

- *Don't know where to start* - Pointing a family at the menu and saying "pick something" is not a good experience because they don't know what to pick. And we're not as good as helping them figure out where to start as we should be.
- *Lacking progression* - It's not only hard for both the new mentors and the families to know where to start, but to understand what the road ahead looks like, or what the end result will be. Giving them a target helps keep them on track toward it. Giving them milestones to achieve help them feel momentum and progression toward the target.
- *Poor categorization* - We don't have things separated/grouped in a consistent and defined manner that focuses on value propositions. We've got a few broad categories and that's it, and even then, things are not well categorized. For example, Code Monster is in introductory JavaScript tutorials. It should be in introductory Game Dev... or both.
- *Lack of content* - We simply don't have enough content properly catalogued and arranged to provide the breadth and depth we need to solve the other problems. I repeat: thin and stale.**
- *Coding is a sport* - How do you get good at a sport? You play it and you practice it. There's no other way. We need to drill that home.

So let's examine how we can solve each problem.

#### Don't know where to start:

This is probably the hardest part, because we don't have a clear taxonomy of skills that we can use to evaluate kids and identify a starting point that is neither too hard nor too easy.
